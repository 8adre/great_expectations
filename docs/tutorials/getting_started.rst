Getting started with Great Expectations
###############

Welcome to Great Expectations! This tutorial will help you set up your first local deployment of Great Expectactions. We'll also introduce important concepts, with links to detailed material you can dig into later. After completing this tutorial, you will know how to

- Initialize a Data Context to manage your project configuration
- Set up a Datasource to connect Great Expectations to sample data
- Create your first Expectations
- Validate data with those Expectations
- View the validation output in Data Docs

Please follow these steps to get started:

   In Great Expectations, your :ref:`Data Context <reference__core_concepts__data_contexts>` manages boilerplate configuration. Using a DataContext is almost always the fastest way to get up and running, even though some teams don't need every component of a DataContext.
   
   Follow these instructions to :ref:`tutorials__getting_started__initialize_a_data_context`.

..
   Alternatively, if you really want to learn the components of Great Expectations without a DataContext, check out `A magic-free introduction to Great Expectations.`_

         </strong>
      </span> Connect to data</h2>
   </embed>

.. container:: custom-indented-paragraph

   Once you have a Data Context, you'll want to connect to data. In Great Expectations, :ref:`Datasources <reference__core_concepts__datasources>` simplify connections, by managing configuration and providing a consistent, cross-platform API for referencing data.
   
   Check out :ref:`tutorials__getting_started__connect_to_data` to learn how to configure your first Datasource.

   :ref:`Expectations <reference__core_concepts__expectations>` are the workhorse abstraction in Great Expectations, a flexible, declarative language for describing the expected characteristics of data.

      <h2><span class="fa-stack">
         <span class="fa fa-circle-o fa-stack-2x"></span>

         </strong>
      </span> Set up Data Docs</h2>
   </embed>

.. container:: custom-indented-paragraph

   One of Great Expectations' core promises is that your tests and documentation will always stay in sync, because docs and tests are both :ref:`compiled from the same Expectations <reference__core_concepts__data_docs>`.
   
   To see how this works, follow :ref:`these instructions <tutorials__getting_started__set_up_data_docs>` to set up a local static website for your data documentation. Later, you'll be able to host the site remotely, or integrate content generated by Great Expectations into an metadata store.

      <h2><span class="fa-stack">
         <span class="fa fa-circle-o fa-stack-2x"></span>
         <strong class="fa-stack-1x">
            5
         </strong>
      </span> Validate your data</h2>
   </embed>

.. container:: custom-indented-paragraph

   In normal usage, the best way to validate data is with a :ref:`Checkpoint`. Checkpoints simplify deployment, by pre-specifying the data and Expectations that to validate at any given point in your data infrastructure, along with follow-up actions to trigger based on the results of validation.

   Follow these instructions to :ref:`set up your first Checkpoint<_tutorials__getting_started__set_up_your_first_checkpoint>`.
